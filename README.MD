## Description
Gamix Electronics is a web application built using the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) with EJS templating.  
The app allows users to **browse, create, edit, and delete electronic products** such as laptops and gaming devices.  
Each product is linked to the user who created it, ensuring secure, personalized content management.

The application features session-based authentication, enabling users to **sign up, log in, and manage their own products**. The UI is styled with a cohesive dark theme, with Flexbox and Grid used for responsive layouts.
